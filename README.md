## Planning Story

In planning for this project, I decided that I would first start by working on the API side of things to make sure that my server was running and that there were no bugs in it before I moved on to the client. Once the API was done, then I began to work on the client and slowly connected each RESTful action up to work with the API until the application was complete. This approach helped to dilute the amount of errors I ran into during development and it was easier to know where the issue was when something stopped working.

### Unsolved Problems

- I want to utilize Bootstrap toasts to tell the user about the result of each of the actions instead of displaying it in a paragraph tag at the top of the page
- I still need to style it and make everything look like it belongs in the world of Legend of Zelda
- I want to add a comment feature to each post
